# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: May 21, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how Scripture Bot ("the Bot") handles data when used on Discord.

## 1. Data Collected

The Bot may collect and store the following data:
- **Server (Guild) IDs**: To store preferences or customization settings specific to each server.

No personal user data (such as usernames, messages, or emails) is stored or logged.

## 2. Purpose of Data Collection

We collect Server IDs to provide customizable features for each Discord server using the Bot (e.g., enabling or disabling biblical references, setting command preferences, etc.).

## 3. Third-Party Hosting

The Bot is hosted by a third-party provider, which may technically have access to data processed or stored by the Bot. We select hosting providers that follow reasonable security practices.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not sell, rent, or share your data with third parties except as required by law.

## 5. Data Retention and Removal

Server-specific data is retained for as long as your server uses the Bot. If your server removes the Bot, associated data may be deleted. You can request manual deletion at any time by contacting us.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The Bot is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal data from individuals under 13 years of age.

## 7. Contact
